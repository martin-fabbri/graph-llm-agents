# Graph LLMs Playground

## Overview
This is a hub for exploring the integration of graph-based orchestration with LLMs. This repository is a collection of experiments, notebooks, and projects aimed at innovating and understanding the capabilities and applications of multi-actor LLM systems. It serves as a space for documenting a journey of discovery and innovation within the AI Agents domain.

## Objective
The primary goal of this playground is to explore the dynamics of coordinating LLMs using graph-based structures, enabling sophisticated workflows and interactions among multiple computational actors. 

## Features
- **Experiment Notebooks**
- **Project Implementations**: Complete project directories showcasing applications of graph-LLM integration, from concept to execution.
- **Documentation & Guides**: In-depth explanations of the experiments and projects, including setup instructions, methodologies, and findings.
- **Resources & References**: Curated list of resources, articles, and papers that provide additional context and support for the experiments conducted.

## Setup Virtual Environment with Poetry
### Step 1: Installing Poetry
```bash
pip install poetry
```
### Step 2: Configuring Poetry
It's a good practice to configure Poetry to create virtual environments within your project's directory. This keeps everything related to your project in one place.
```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```
