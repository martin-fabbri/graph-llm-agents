Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, Observation is understanding relevant information from an Action's output and Action can be of three types:
(1) <search>entity</search>, which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search and you can try to search the information from those topics.
(2) <lookup>keyword</lookup>, which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current context. This only does exact matches, so keep your searches short.
(3) <finish>answer</finish>, which returns the answer and finishes the task.

Here are some examples.
