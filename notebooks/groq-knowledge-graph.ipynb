Cook is the CEO of Apple Inc., who joined the company in 1998 and took over as CEO in 2009. \\nUnder his leadership, Apple became the world\\'s largest company by market capitalization and revenue, thanks to cost-saving measures such as long-term deals for flash memory that led to popular devices like the iPod Nano, iPhone, and iPad. \\nApple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, with the Macintosh computer, introduced in 1984, being a revolutionary graphical user interface-based system designed for the masses. \\nThe Macintosh team, led by Jef Raskin and later Steve Jobs, faced challenges in bringing the revolutionary design to life but generated cult enthusiasm with new programs like PageMaker, MORE, and Excel. \\nApple released improved versions of the Macintosh, like the Macintosh 512K, to address initial limitations. \\nApple bought NeXT in 1997, bringing Jobs back as CEO, resulting in game-changing products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.  \\n\\n= SECOND ITERATION = \\nTimothy D.
